# Ripped

An Exercism-like application for the Turing School of Software and Design.

### Installation

 - clone down this repo `git clone https://github.com/turingschool-projects/ripped`
 - run `bundle install`
 - we're using a custom version of a gem for staging, so also run: `bundle update`
 - login is - at the moment - handled through [Census](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/census). as this is not yet in production you will probably need to stub out your users - we'll update as soon as this changes. You'll need Census access to run the app.
